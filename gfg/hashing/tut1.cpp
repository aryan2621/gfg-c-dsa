// hashing is mainly for the implment the dictionaries have thats key values pairs
// it also helps in cases of sets.
// it provides search insert and delete in O(1) on average.
// in hashing all the values are unique.
// in case of duplicates the old one overrites the new one.

// all the other data structures work slower than hashing
// hashing is best in delete, insert and search.

// in array O(n) for insert and delete and search (unordered) and O(logn) for search(sorted);
// binary search tree takes O(logn) for search insert and delete.

// some function are not available in hashing that are avaiable through the other data structure.

// not useful for
// -> finding closest value-> for these avl tree is red black tree is best
// -> sorted data;->
// -> prefix searching;-> trie is best for this
