// Quick Sort 

// Divide and Conquerer algorithms 
// The key part is partioning (Hoare,Lomuto and Naive)
// Worst time complexity is O(n^2);
// Despite having the higher worst case time ,it is preffered over 
// algorithms many times due to following reasons;

// 1-> Tail recursive 
// 2-> In -Place 
// 3-> Cache Friendly 
// 4-> Average can be theta(nlogn);

// its preffered over another sort techniques specially in the array
// for linked list quick sort is preffered
