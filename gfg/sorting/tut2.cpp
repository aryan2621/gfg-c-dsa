// stability in sorting algorithms

// arr[] = {{"Anil,50"},{"Ayan",80},{"Piyush",50},{"Ramesh",80}};
// in case of coinciding of marks the array must sort in the order as in time of input it was;

// o-> {{"Anil",50},{"Piyush",50},{"Ayan",80},{"Ramesh",80}};

// stable and sorted
// its useful in array of objects.

// all other than stable are unstable.

// Example -> Bubble sort ,Insertion sort and merge sort are stable.

// Example -> Selection sort ,Quick sort and Heap sort are unstable.


//Bubble sort-> It always compares adjacent elements.arr[i] and arr[i+1]

//Selection sort-> 18 4 3 8 3
//                  3 4 3 8 13
//
