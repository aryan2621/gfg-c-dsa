// Binary Heap;

// -> used in heap sort;
// -> used to implement priority queue
// -> two types
// ->-> Min heap (height priority item is assigned lowest value)
// ->-> Max Heap(heighest prority item is assigned highest value)

// Binary Heap is a complete Binary tree(store as an array);



// Min heap ->complete binary tree;
// -> Every node has value smaller that its descendents
